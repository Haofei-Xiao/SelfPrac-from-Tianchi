# SelfPrac-from-Tianchi
some data analysis projects I did by analyzing the datasets downloaded from Tianchi.\\
the "game analysis" is a program outputing the user the post the top 10 clicks video in Bilibili under topic "the honor of kings". \\
the "user behavior" is a program showing the similarity of websites visited by Taobao users. \\
"rental house info analysis" is more of a complete project: 
    a. it has keyword extractions showing rental info people care most about; 
    b. prediction of price interest level; 
    c. and data visualization given different features (see details in report)
