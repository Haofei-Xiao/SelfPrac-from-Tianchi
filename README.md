# SelfPrac-from-Tianchi
some data analysis projects I did by analyzing the datasets downloaded from Tianchi
the "game analysis" is a program outputing the user the post the top 10 clicks video in Bilibili under topic "the honor of kings"
the "user behavior" is a program showing the similarity of websites visited by Taobao users
"rental house info analysis" is more of a complete project: 
    it has keyword extractions showing rental info people care most about; 
    prediction of price interest level; 
    and data visualization given different features (see details in report)
